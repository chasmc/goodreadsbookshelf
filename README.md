Initial Thoughts:

- too much going on

- needs visual hierarchy to make the flow more intuitive.

- needs to be cleaned up. Very overwhelming. needs organization.
needs a starting point.

- remove home button

- not currently automatically responsive. User must click link.

- simplify simplify simplify!!!

- no kids section



Threats:

- seems that Riffle may be the biggest threat. The layout
  is vastly superior and is geared toward ease of use for the user.
